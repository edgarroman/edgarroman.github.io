Aspen™ is a popular online grade book used by many school districts.</p><p>Grade Corner was originally inspired by being frustrated with grade visibility for my children attending public schools in Washington, DC. It allowed me a chance to learn React Native while serving a real need. I built the first prototype using <a href=https://expo.io>Expo</a> and released it. After showing the app to a few family and friends, it quickly gained popularity in the local middle school. And then started to grow city-wide. It has a &lsquo;sweet spot&rsquo; of being naturally viral when students are using it - their friends quickly adopt it.</p><p>Then one Christmas break, while visiting family in Massachusetts, we discovered that nieces and nephews are also using Aspen. So the app was adapted for their school district. Eventually, more and more school districts were added including Chicago Public Schools and Boston Public Schools.</p><p>Now I have thousands of students and parents using the app <em>every day</em>. I&rsquo;m proud of my contribution to students all over the country who are benefiting from this app. It is fairly low cost for me to continue to maintain this app, but it does take a substantial amount of time to add new features and perform tech support.</p><h2 id=live-streaming-church-with-obs>Live Streaming Church with OBS</h2><p>I&rsquo;m a volunteer at my local church and during the pandemic of 2020, I set up and operated the live stream for worship services.
I learned about OBS and remote control cameras. The OBS setup was complex and I should really blog about that.</p><h2 id=zappa-contributions>Zappa Contributions</h2><p>I wrote a nice guide to <a href=https://romandc.com/zappa-django-guide/>Using Django with Zappa</a>. I wrote that a few years ago
and periodically refresh it. But really it&rsquo;s a bit out of date and the course I mentioned above is much more comprehensive.</p><p>TBH, this information should be moved into the <a href=https://github.com/zappa/Zappa>Zappa</a> docs proper.</p></div></div></div></main><script src=https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js integrity=sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity=sha384-ChfqqxuZUCnJSK3+MXmPNIyE6ZbWh2IMqE241rYiqJxyMiZ6OW/JmZQ5stwEULTy crossorigin=anonymous></script><footer class=page-footer><div class="footer-copyright text-center py-3">©
