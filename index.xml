I have experience in the software development world, focused recently on online video streaming and cloud services.
I&amp;rsquo;ve served as Senior Director of Product Development for the Public Broadcasting Service and have launched numerous streaming video services on web, mobile, and OTT platforms. I&amp;rsquo;m well-versed in network architecture with a focus on Information Security and High Availability.</description></item><item><title>Projects</title><link>https://romandc.com/projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://romandc.com/projects/</guid><description>Serverless Django with Zappa I am the author of Serverless Django with Zappa.
I was introduced to Django in 2009 and I consider it my go-to web framework. With continuous support from a vibrant community in addition to an incredibly rich ecosystem, I would be hard pressed to find another framework that matches up.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Zappa to host my Django applications for several years now, and I have found no other solution that is as powerful and cost-effective as serverless Django hosting on AWS &amp;ndash; especially for the solo developer working to get a product to market.</description></item></channel></rss>
